## Creating sets.

### Extensional definition

`The number one, two and three {1,2,3}`

To create a set of this type just create a new instance of the set and pass the
elements as parameters of it's constructor.

```coffee
f3 = new Set 1,2,3
```

### Intensional definition
`All natural numbers or â„•`

You can currently create a set of elements by creating a set with a function that
gets an element as parameter and returns a boolean. This function will be used to
check the membership of the element to the set.

```coffee
N = new Set (x) -> x > 0
```

---

## Working with sets

### Union

The union of two sets returns a second set which elements are all the members that
are contained in the sets involved in it's creation.

```coffee
odd = new Set (x) -> x % 2 != 0
one = new Set 1
u = odd.union one

u.match 1 # this is true
u.match 2 # this is true
u.match 3 # this is false
```

### Intersection

The intersection return a set that holds as members the elements that are members
of both involved in it's creation.

```coffee
odd = new Set (x) -> x % 2 != 0
onetwo = new Set 1,2
i = odd.intersect onetwo

i.match 1 # this is true
i.match 2 # this is true
i.match 3 # this is false
i.match 4 # this is false
```

### Disjoint
The disjoint is a difference operator, [A - B] Returns a new set that contains
all elements in a but not in B.

```coffee
odd = new Set (x) -> x % 2 != 0
two = new Set 2

d = odd.disjoint two

i.match 4 # this is true
i.match 2 # this is false
```

### Chaining

Sets are intended as inmutable objects. That's the reason every funciton over sets
returns a new set in response. This allows for easy chaining.

```coffee
s = new Set(1).union(new Set(2)).intersect(new Set(3))
```

This is just an example, but you get the point.

Note that we are using numeric types here, but you can use whatever thing you want. Even
complex objects. :bowtie:

## TODO

- Set mapping
- Set limits
- Other set operations. (disjoint, relative complement)
