###
	A implementation of mathematical sets the functional way.

	@Auhor: Ruben Paz (Istar-Eldritch)
###
module.exports = class Set

	###
		The constructor of a set takes an element that might be a whatever amount of
		literals.
		If the element is a function it has to take an element of the set and return
		a boolean if the set contains the element.
		(x):Boolean -> f(x)
	###
	constructor: (@e) ->
  	if not (@e instanceof Function)
    	@e = _.reduce arguments,(mem, elem) ->
      	(x) -> mem(x,elem) or x is elem
     	,(x,e) -> x is e

	###
		This function checks if the element x is member of this set.
		TODO: Feature to allow this function to check for subsets.
	###
	match: (x) ->
		@e(x)

	###
		Creates a second set resulting from the union of the two sets implied.
		The union set matches elements from both sets.
	###
	union: (s) -> (x) -> @e(x) or ss.match(x)

	###
		Creates a second set resulting from the intersection of the two sets implied.
	  The new set matches elements that are members of both sets at same time.
	###
	intersect: (s) -> (x) -> @e(x) and s.match(x)
